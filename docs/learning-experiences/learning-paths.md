# Learning Paths

Learning paths help you create structured learning journeys by combining multiple courses into a cohesive educational experience. You can design paths that guide learners through a specific skill set or knowledge domain.

## Managing Learning Paths

The learning paths interface provides a clear overview of all your paths, showing:

- Path name and description
- Number of courses included in each path
- Actions available for each path (View, Edit, View Completions, Destroy)

### Creating a Learning Path

When creating a new learning path, you can configure:

1. **Basic Information**

   - Title and subtitle
   - Description
   - Learning path image
   - Difficulty level
   - Language preferences
   - Skills and industries targeting

2. **Content Structure**

   - Select courses from available catalog
   - Arrange courses in logical order
   - Set prerequisites if needed
   - Add custom content blocks between courses

3. **Settings**
   - Visibility (public or private)
   - Completion requirements
   - Badges and certificates options

### Customization Options

Each learning path can be customized with:

- Custom badges upon completion
- Certificates for successful completion
- Course sequencing requirements
- Progress tracking metrics

You can also group similar learning paths into a learning path group.
