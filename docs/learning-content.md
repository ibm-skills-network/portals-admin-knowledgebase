# Learning Content

The Learning Content section serves as your central hub for managing all educational resources available in your portal. Here you'll find tools to discover, install, and manage various types of learning materials like courses and guided projects.

## Content Providers

### Skills Network Catalog

The Skills Network Catalog is your primary source for official content. As an administrator, you'll receive regular updates about new and updated content directly in your inbox. The catalog interface provides a comprehensive view of all available content that gets pushed to the catalog.

You can easily browse the catalog using various filters such as tier, topic, difficulty level, language, skills, industries, and platform. The interface clearly shows what's installed, what's available to install, and what needs updating. A convenient search function helps you find specific content quickly.

### Other Catalogs

Beyond the Skills Network Catalog, your portal can integrate with content you create, third-party content, and even custom catalogs. This includes content created in Studio and other external sources, giving you flexibility in building your learning ecosystem.
