# Introduction

Welcome to the Portal Admin Guide! This comprehensive guide will help you navigate and manage your learning portal effectively.

## What is a Portal?

A Skills Network Portal is an online learning platform that provides access to content from the Skills Network and others catalogs. Think of it like a custom app store for learning - just as you get apps from the App Store or Google Play, a portal allows your organization to:

- Access pre-built learning content from the Skills Network Catalog
- Create and host your own custom courses
- Build learning paths and journeys
- Manage competitions and events
- Track learner progress and achievements

## Understanding Open edX

The portal works alongside Open edX, a powerful open-source learning platform used by millions of learners worldwide. It consists of two main components:

1. **Learning Management System (LMS)**: The platform where learners take courses, track progress, and earn certificates
2. **Course Management System (CMS/Studio)**: The authoring tool where you can create and manage courses

## How to Access Administrative Settings

To access the administrative settings in the learning portal:

1. Click your profile picture icon in the top right corner of the screen
2. Look for the 'Admin' option in the dropdown menu
3. Click 'Admin' to access the admin dashboard

Note: You must have manager privileges to see and access the Admin option.

## Portal Settings Overview

The portal comes with a comprehensive set of configuration options including:

- General site settings
- User registration configuration
- Header and footer customization
- Visual styling options
- Course and content management

- And much more!

- Customize logos, menus, headers, and footers through an intuitive point-and-click interface
